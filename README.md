Link to paper: to be published.

Here you can find the code to reproduce the results covered in Mederer et al. 2024 (to be accepted).

### Installation 
This project includes both python code for model training and R code for RTM data generation.
Python code is based on tensorflow v2.7.0 and python v3.9.5.
For further installation details for the python environment, please refer to the python requirement.txt file.

R code is based on R version 4.1.0 "Camp Pontanezen". 

### Data availability 
An unprocessed version of the original dataset and trained models can be found here: https://gitlab.com/eya95/multi-traitretrieval

Unprocessed RTM datasets can be found on Zenodo under this link: https://zenodo.org/records/10932767?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjcyYzMwZWM5LTRhZmItNGI0YS04MWExLTU3NmZlYzZkZGExMCIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiIwNmVkOGZiNDYyODllOWU5M2UwMjIwNDNlOTg0NzM5NCJ9.2Dz1rM2ZP_CIVpCfl-9ouc5YO7800hoRpVvIvmL_M9Nkt-_SK0UJgw2-jymtrSCwUx0KaCHnCEqrkAi6-74dfw
